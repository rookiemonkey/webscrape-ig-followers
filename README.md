1. Define your ig username/password env vars on .env. 
  - This is needed since IG always redirect to login page when navigating to an ig profile w/o any logged in account\
  - if you have 2-factor auth you need to turn it off for the mean time but i'll deal with that later so we dont need to turn it off

2. Run bot
```$ npm run get-followers```
